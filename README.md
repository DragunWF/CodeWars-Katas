# My Kata Solutions in CodeWars

## Description

Welcome! This is just a repository for my kata solutions in CodeWars, feel free to look around! One
note thought is that I used to store this locally so you might not see as many things in my commit
history.

One note that I should give out is that not all of my solutions are clean. A lot of them was solved
back when I were new to programming so you can pretty much guess how dirty my old solutions
are.
