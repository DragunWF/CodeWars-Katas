## About

üí° **Why Competitive Programming?**

Competitive programming has been an essential part of honing my skills in algorithms, data structures, and efficient problem-solving. Each solution in this repository highlights:

- **Optimization**: Writing efficient code with optimal time and space complexity.
- **Modular Approach**: Ensuring the code is clean, readable, and reusable.
- **Platform Diversity**: Tackling challenges from multiple platforms to expand my versatility.

This repository is **structured** by platform and problem type to allow for easier navigation and study. Feel free to explore the folders to see how different problems are approached.
