## Description

Welcome! This is just a repository for my kata solutions in CodeWars, feel free to look around! One
note thought is that I used to store this locally so you might not see as many things in my commit
history.

**Word of warning:** Some of my solutions are... well kind of dirty.

## Disclaimer

- Code Warriors are strongly encouraged not to look at your solutions to a kata until they have completed it themselves or at least taken the time to think about their own approaches.
- Code Warriors should not submit your solutions as their own.
- You will not be accepting contributions of any kind to this repository.
- Creating a repository like this is discouraged by CodeWars.
